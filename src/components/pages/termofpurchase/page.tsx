                <li>The delivery fees are based on the delivery of one Order to a single address within the Philippines. Promotional delivery fees may apply at our discretion and may be withdrawn at any time before the Order is confirmed.</li>
                <li>We will try our best to meet your chosen delivery date and timeslot, however, there may be times where we are unable to do so, and when this happens, we will contact you to re-arrange the delivery date and timeslot.</li>
                <li>You shall inform us of any delivery restrictions or difficulty in accessing your property when you place an Order, and ensure that the relevant permits are obtained from the building/residential management prior to the scheduled delivery date. If you live in a gated community, compound, or condominium complex, you shall be wholly responsible for obtaining clearance or permits for the entry and exit of the delivery personnel from such gated community, compound or condominium complex. This includes prepaying or clearing any fees that are assessed against delivery vehicles or personnel.</li>
                <li>Our service providers are not obliged to wait for you to grant our service providers access to the property as they will have to fulfill other deliveries scheduled for the day. If they leave, any attempt at re-delivery shall be subject to a re-attendance fee.</li>
                <li>On delivery, it is your responsibility to examine the Product(s), check the condition of the packaging, and ensure that the correct number of packages has been delivered and you will be asked to sign the proof of delivery to confirm this. If there are any issues, you should detail this accordingly on the proof of delivery. Missing Product(s) will be re-ordered and damaged/incorrect Product(s) will be returned and replaced and delivered free of charge only if you highlight it on the point of delivery. If you refuse to sign the delivery document, this will be taken as a refusal to accept delivery.</li>
                <li>Please make plans to be available to accept your delivery. If you are not available, there must be a person aged 18 years and above that is capable of receiving delivery on your behalf, and you agree that we can rely on such person's instructions as if they were your own. We are not obliged to verify that that person has been authorized by you to receive delivery of the Order.

                <li>Every effort will be made to deliver the Product(s) to your stipulated address, provided that it is safe and feasible to do so. If our service providers are of the view that it is unsafe for their personnel or for any other person to deliver the Product(s) to the address, or that any attempted delivery is likely to cause damage to the Product(s) or to the property at the stipulated address (including surrounding property), they will let you know and if you still decide to proceed with the delivery, we will not be liable for any damage caused to the Product(s) or any property.</li>
                <li>Our service providers will not use any specialized lifting equipment and/or remove any fixtures at the stipulated address (e.g. doors, windows, doorframes, etc.) in order to complete the delivery. If any of such equipment or removal is required, you must arrange these before the delivery takes place. Our service providers will not unpack or assemble delivered Product(s) or remove any packaging unless you have placed an Order for assembly services. If you are concerned about possible damage to the Property (e.g. flooring etc.) during the delivery, please make sure you cover the property (e.g. flooring, etc.) with protective sheets.</li>
